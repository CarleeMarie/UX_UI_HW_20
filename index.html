        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>We used Bumble and Tinder as our direct competitors and Facebook, Meetup, and Peanut as our indirect competitors. 

          We understood that Tinder is the biggest dating app out there and one of the first
          ones that had features such as swiping left or right, and super likes. Bumble
          also has the feature to specifically meet friends on the app and we wanted to know
          how users were interacting with that. 
          
          With an app like Facebook the whole point is to stay connected with friends and family, and
          because it is such a large platform that so many people use, we knew there would be a
          lot to look at.

        Proto-Persona: Andi is a 25-year-old software engineer living in Los Angeles. She is trying to find new friends because she just moved. She wants an easy way to make friends without dealing with ghosting, not following through when planning to meet up, and she doesn’t want to use a dating app because guys aren’t looking for friends.

        THe first step in our research process was to brainstorm who the typical user of the hey bestie! app might be and
        created a proto-persona.
        
        Andi is a general idea of who we thought might be interested in using an app that helps women make friends.
        Next, we decided to conduct a survey online to see what women's general interest level was
        for such an app. Extrapolating from that data, we came up with a research plan and conducted 6 interviews. 
        
        Research Plan
        Here we decided we wanted to create and app that allows people to make friends. We came up with some questions that
        pertain to our app idea, and then found an idea that we can create interview questions off of which was, “how do people
        make friends.” Would you be interested in an app where you can make new friends?
        
        Do you use dating apps? If so, which app was the best?
        
        What was annoying about using dating apps. 
        
        Have you made any new friends through an app before? If so, which one?
        
        Are there struggles to making friends in your daily life.  After creating a plan we made a hypothesis about how user would feel about the importance of our app. 
        “If people are able to easily connect with one another then they will feel more included in their community.""  
        
        Having that done the user research, we had a lot of data and were able to make a large affinity map that led to a thorough empathy map on which we based our user persona.

      <p class="lead">Conclusion: Doing initial research about what apps exist even before creating a proto-persona helped to narrow our focus and also to see where there were gaps in what is already available. 
        In a project like this one, we noticed that team members naturally took up different responsibilities according to our abilities and affinities. Having each person take responsibility for set tasks made things work smoothly and take less time overall. 
        Feedback (both user and team member) is invaluable. At each step we would get feedback and it helped direct our focus.
        Next Steps 
        
        Building out the user profile 
        Adding to the suggested matches
